# Hands-On Lab: Complete the Automate Claims Process

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will complete the configuration of an imported **Automate process**.

The starting process already contains the foundation of the workflow. Your job is to finish the process by adding logic for:

- Determining how the process was started
- Creating and updating the claim number
- Handling errors when the claim folder cannot be created
- Supporting multiple file uploads
- Determining whether uploaded files need to be processed
- Looping through uploaded files
- Moving each uploaded file into the appropriate claim folder

This hands-on lab begins with an existing imported process. You are **not** creating the entire process from scratch.

📦 [Download cic-dev-upload-examples.zip](claim-upload-docs/cic-dev-upload-examples.zip)(Right click to open in new tab)  

---  

## ✅ Initial Test
1. Import the _gb-cui-claim-classStart_ project into Modeler.
2. Reassign the **"create-claim"** and **"display-JSON"** User Tasks to yourself _ex.(TrainB12)_.

Release and deploy the project in **Studio Admin**. Once deployed, test the process and get a feel for what it does.

### 🔍 Testing Checklist
Verify that:

- [ ] Once the process starts a **User Task** is assigned to you with a claim form to be filled out.
- [ ] Fill out the form, and attach a document to the form.
- [ ] The process completes without error once the Human Task is completed.
- [ ] Visit the _uidev_claims_ folder in the local repository to ensure a new folder was created for your claim. Inside should be a generated document and the document you attached.

## 🧪 LAB 1: Variable Manipulation & Saving to Process

> [!NOTE]
> **Lab Objective:** Configure the process logic used to establish and update the claim number.

In this lab, you will add the Script Tasks required to determine the process origin and establish the claim number used throughout the process.


### Step 1: Process and Script Task Variables 
In this step we'll add the `create-claim-num` Script Task and edit process variable(s).

1. Open the imported process in **Automate**.
2. Locate the **Start Event**.
3. Add a **Script Task** immediately after the Start Event.
4. Name the Script Task:

   `create-claim-num`

5. Connect the Start Event to `create-claim-num`.

Your process should begin with a flow similar to:

```text
Start
  |
  v
create-claim-num
```

### Configure the Script

1. Select the `create-claim-num` Script Task.
2. Open the script configuration.
3. Paste the following code into the script editor and finish the logic:
```
// assign the Unix timestamp as the claim number for the var_claimNumber process variable

```  

### Configure Variable Mapping

1. Select **Edit Script Variables**.
2. Add a new script variable using the **+ Create Script Variable** button.
3. Add _var_claimNumber_ as a variable, configuration:
   - **Variable Category:** ```Input/Output```
   - **Type:** ```string```
4. Save.

Configure the Script Task to use **variable mapping** for the required process variables.

> [!TIP]
> Verify that the variables required by the script are available to the Script Task before continuing.

1. Select the Script task and set the **Mapping Type** to ```Map Variables```.
2. Set the **input** and **output** to _var_claimNumber_.

### Checkpoint

Before continuing, verify that:

- [ ] The Script Task is named `create-claim-num`.
- [ ] It appears immediately after the Start Event.
- [ ] The provided source script has been added.
- [ ] The required logic has been entered.
- [ ] Variable mapping has been configured.

---

## 🧪 LAB 2: Conditional Logic to Customize Claims
> [!NOTE]
> **Lab Objective:** Add a Script Task that uses conditional logic to customize our claim number.

Next, add the logic that updates the claim number used by the process.

1. Add another **Script Task** after the _create-claim-num_ Script Task and before the _create-folder_ Task.
2. Name the task: `update-claim-num`
3. Create a new Script with the same title.
4. Paste the provided helper function:  
```
// =================================================
// INSTRUCTOR HANDS-ON TYPING: 
// Use the Helper function to determine if the webhook JSON contains data
// If it does, append add "W" to the claim Number, else add "F"
// ===========| START CODE HERE |===================

// set a local variable called claimNum as a reference to our var_claimNumber process variable


// make process variable var_updatedClaimNum the value of the claimNum


// create a local variable called inbound that references the webhook payload process variable: var_inboundRequest


// 1. Write a conditional logic "if" statement using helper function: 
//    if webhook: prepend "W", form prepend "F"
// 2. Create a local id variable assigned as either "W" or "F"


// prepend the id to the updated claim number process variable: var_updatedClaimNum


// ============| END CODE HERE |====================
// PROVIDED Helper: Determine if JSON contains data
// =================================================
function hasJsonData(jsonObject) {
    try {
        // ============================================
        // Null / undefined
        // ============================================
        if (jsonObject === null || jsonObject === undefined) {
            return false;
        }

        // ============================================
        // Automate / Java Map-style JSON object
        // ============================================
        if (typeof jsonObject.get === "function") {

            // Preferred check
            if (typeof jsonObject.isEmpty === "function") {
                return !jsonObject.isEmpty();
            }

            // Fallback check
            if (typeof jsonObject.size === "function") {
                return jsonObject.size() > 0;
            }

            return false;
        }

        // ============================================
        // Standard JavaScript JSON object
        // ============================================
        if (typeof jsonObject === "object") {
            return Object.keys(jsonObject).length > 0;
        }

        return false;

    } catch (error) {
        return false;
    }
}
```
4. Above the helper function, write the conditional logic Javascript to call the function.
5. Save.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the supplied source script as the starting point and type the requested `if` logic manually.

### Checkpoint

Verify that:

- [ ] The Script Task is named `update-claim-num`.
- [ ] The supplied script has been added.
- [ ] The required `if` statement has been entered.
- [ ] The task is connected correctly within the existing process flow.

## 🧪 LAB 3: Process changes & Error Handling
> [!NOTE]
> **Lab Objectives:**
> 1. The process currently attempts to create a claim folder. If the expected base claims directory does not exist, the process needs a controlled way to handle the failure. You will add an error path that informs the user of the problem instead of allowing the process to fail without explanation.
> 2. The Custom Folder and Generated Claim Document **names** are too simple and can use some level of customization.

---  

**Created Folder Name Enhancement**
1. Select the Create Folder task.
2. Change the value of the **Name** attribute to: ```claim-[your initials]-${var_updatedClaimNum}```.
> [!TIP]
> **Expressions and Interpolation**
> Using a variable with dollar-bracket syntax, such as `${var_updatedClaimNum}`, is called an **expression**. An expression allows you to reference the current value of a process variable.
>
> When you combine text with an expression, this is called **string interpolation**.
>
> For example:
>
> `claim-jd-${var_updatedClaimNum}`
>
> If `var_updatedClaimNum` contains `12345`, the resulting value will be:
>
> `claim-jd-12345`

---  

**Error Boundary Event for the Create Folder Task**
1. Add an **Intermediate Throw Event** to the _create-folder_ task and use the wrench icon to select an ERROR event.
2. Configure the event to catch: `ANY ERROR`
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Error Event must be attached to the **Create Folder** task as a boundary event.

---  

**Process Variable We'll Need.**
1. Create a process variable called: ```customErrorMessage``` as a _String_ variable.
> [!TIP]
> Creating a variable to store a custom error message allows us to display in a Human Task or send to the error log.

---  

**Script Task to Set our Custom Error**
1. Create a new **Script Task** and a **New Script**, title them: ```custom-folder-error```
2. Open the script, and paste in the following template. :
```
// assign a custom message string for the process variable: customErrorMessage
// Use a string similar to: "The base Claim folder '/uidev_claims' could not be found. Ensure this directory exists and try again!"


```
 
4. Set the mapping on the script task to _Map all inputs/outputs variables_.
5. Create a Human task stemming from the _custom-folder-error_ script titled: ```folder-error-notify```
6. Create a form with the same name, ```folder-error-notify``` and attach it to the human task.
7. Open the form and add a **Display Text** Field with id: ```errorMessage```.
8. Go back to process and select the Human task. Assign the _Display Text_ the process variable: ```customErrorMessage```.
9. Add an **End Event** after the Human task.

---  

### Checkpoint

Verify that:

- [ ] An Error Boundary Event is attached to Create Folder.
- [ ] The boundary event catches `ANY ERROR`.
- [ ] The Error Event flows to a Human Task.
- [ ] The Human Task uses the `folder-error-notify` form.
- [ ] The form contains the required Display Text message.
- [ ] The Human Task flows to an End Event.

---  

## ✅ Phase 1 Test
The file and folder unique naming logic is now in the process. Release, Upgrade, and Test your process.

### 🔍 Testing Checklist
Verify that:

- [ ] Once the process starts a **User Task** is assigned to you with a claim form to be filled out.
- [ ] Fill out the form, and attach a document to the form.
- [ ] The process completes without error once the Human Task is completed.
- [ ] Visit the _uidev_claims_ folder in the local repository. The folder and generated document name should now reflect our updated naming convention.

---  

## 🧪 LAB 4: Support Multiple File Uploads
> [!NOTE]
> **Lab Objective:** The current process supports only a single uploaded file. You will modify the process so that users can attach multiple files to a claim and the process can handle each uploaded file individually.

---

### Step 1: Create the Required Process Variables

Create the following process variables:

| Variable | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `var_attachedFile` | `contentArray` | Stores the files uploaded by the user |
| `doc_fileToMove` | `content` | Stores the individual file currently being processed |
| `var_processFiles` | `Boolean` | Determines whether another file should be processed |
| `var_currentIndex` | `Integer` | Tracks the current file within the uploaded file collection |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pay close attention to the variable types. `var_attachedFile` contains the collection of uploaded files, while `doc_fileToMove` represents **one file** from that collection.

---

### Step 2: Modify the `create-claim` Form

1. Open the existing `create-claim` form.
2. Locate the current **File Upload** component.
3. Change the component from:

```text
Single File Upload
```

to:

```text
Multiple File Upload
```

The form will now allow the user to select and upload multiple files.

---

### Step 3: Update the `create-claim` Human Task

1. Return to the process model and select the existing `create-claim` Human Task.
2. Update the task's file-related input and output mappings to use:

`var_attachedFile`

The files submitted through the form should now be stored in the `var_attachedFile` process variable.

### Checkpoint

Verify that:

- [ ] The form allows multiple files to be uploaded.
- [ ] `var_attachedFile` is a `contentArray`.
- [ ] The Human Task maps the uploaded files to `var_attachedFile`.

---

## 🧪 LAB 5: Determine Origination of the Process (Webhook or Manual Form Entry)
> [!NOTE]
> **Lab Objective:** This process can be started from a webhook HTTP call from the **9 Second Insurance Website** or **Manually**. We need a method, at runtime, to determine how the process was started since the file handling is different for each origination.

**Add the _validate-origin_ Script Task**
1. Create a new **Script Task** and **Script Object** titled: `validate-origin`.
2. Place the script task after the _create-folder_ task and before the _gateway_.
3. Configure the mapping to: **Map all inputs/outputs variables**
4. Add the following script template and fill in the rest of the Javascript necessary.
```
// ============================================
// INSTRUCTOR HANDS-ON TYPING: 
// Use the Helper function to determine if the webhook JSON contains data
// If it does, set process variable v_originForm to false, else true
// ============================================

// create a local variable called inbound with a reference to the process variable var_inboundRequest


// Conditional statement that leverages the hasJsonData helper function to determine if the inbound var has value
// if the inbound var has value, set process var v_originForm to false, else true



// ============================================
// Helper: Determine if JSON contains data
// ============================================
function hasJsonData(jsonObject) {
    try {
        // ============================================
        // Null / undefined
        // ============================================
        if (jsonObject === null || jsonObject === undefined) {
            return false;
        }

        // ============================================
        // Automate / Java Map-style JSON object
        // ============================================
        if (typeof jsonObject.get === "function") {

            // Preferred check
            if (typeof jsonObject.isEmpty === "function") {
                return !jsonObject.isEmpty();
            }

            // Fallback check
            if (typeof jsonObject.size === "function") {
                return jsonObject.size() > 0;
            }

            return false;
        }

        // ============================================
        // Standard JavaScript JSON object
        // ============================================
        if (typeof jsonObject === "object") {
            return Object.keys(jsonObject).length > 0;
        }

        return false;

    } catch (error) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following Gateway and sequence flow lines are already configured to refer to the process variable _v_originForm_ to flow in the correct direction based on the setting of the script.

---  

## 🧪 LAB 6: Establish the Looping Mechanism to move the uploaded files
> [!NOTE]
> **Lab Objective:** We'll create the looping mechanism to grab each file uploaded in the manual form process. This will need two script tasks: _check-for-files_ and _looping-logic_. 
> The process now needs to determine whether any files were uploaded.
> - If files exist, the process will begin processing them.
> - If no files exist, the process will skip file processing.

**Create the File Check Script Task**. 
1. Create a new **Script Task** and **Script Object** both named: ```check-for-files```.
2. Add the following script template and write the Javascript to perform these actions. The script will determine whether files exist and prepare the variables used by the upcoming gateway.
```
// create a local variable called attachedFiles that gets a reference to the var_attachedFile process variable


// set process variable var_processFiles to True or False
// false if process var attachedFiles has no files 
// (hint: use.length to ensure there's > 0 objects in array)


// set process variable var_currentIndex tp 0 
// (to start the looping index at the 1st position in the array)


// write a conditional statement that checks if attachedFiles has > 0 data
// action: sets the process var doc_fileToMove to the variables.var_currentIndex of the attachedFiles array


```

### Checkpoint

Verify that:

- [ ] Mapping is configured for **All Input / Output**.
- [ ] The supplied source script has been written / added.

---  

**Update the Move Content Task**
1. Select the existing **Move Content** task.
2. Locate the `sourceContent` configuration.
3. Change its value to: `doc_fileToMove`
 
> [!NOTE]
> `var_attachedFile` contains all uploaded files. `doc_fileToMove` contains the single file currently being processed.
> The Move Content task should now move the **current individual file** in the var_attachedFile array, rather than moving the single file.

---

**Add the File Looping Logic Script**  
After a file has been moved, the process needs to determine whether another uploaded file remains.

**Add the Looping Script**
1. Create a new **Script Task** and **Script element**, both titled ```loop-logic```.
2. Set the script task mapping to: ```Map all inputs/outputs variables```.
3. Paste the following script template and write in the necessary Javascript to complete the tasks. This script will update the variables required to determine whether another uploaded file needs to be processed.
```
// create a local variable called attachedFiles with a reference to the var_attachedFile process variable


// create a local variable called currentIndex with a reference to the var_currentIndex process variable


// Increment currentIndex by 1


// Save updated currentIndex back to the process variable var_currentIndex


// Write the following Conditional Statement: 
// Has currentIndex exceeded the number of indexes within the attachedFiles array?
// if exceeded, set process variable var_processFiles = false
// else 
//.  (1)set the process variable var_processFiles = true and
//.  (2)doc_fileToMove value to the next index of the attachedFiles array


```


**Loop Back to the Gateway**
1. Create a sequence flow from the _looping-logic_ script task back to the _Exclusive Gateway_.
The resulting loop should resemble:

```text
                  < Exclusive Gateway >
                    /              \
                   /                \
      processFiles == true         Default
                 |                    |
                 v                    v
          Move Content              End
                 |
                 v
          looping-logic
                 |
                 +--------------------+
                        Loop Back
```

Each time the process returns to the gateway, `var_processFiles` is evaluated again.

---

**Configure the End Path**
1. Add an **End Event** to the second output path of the Exclusive Gateway, **if not already there**.
2. Configure this sequence flow as the: **Default Flow**

The gateway should behave as follows:

| Gateway Path | Configuration | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Move Content | `var_processFiles == true` | Process the current uploaded file |
| End | Default | No additional files need to be processed |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The End path should be configured as the **Default Flow**, rather than using a second condition such as `var_processFiles == false`.

---

## Final Process Logic

When complete, the file-processing portion of the process should operate conceptually like this:

```text
                         create-claim
                              |
                              v
                       Check Attachments
                              |
                              v
                     < Exclusive Gateway >
                       /              \
                      /                \
   var_processFiles == true           Default
                    |                    |
                    v                    v
              Move Content             End
                    |
                    v
              looping-logic
                    |
                    |
                    +-----------> Gateway
```

The overall behavior is:

1. The user submits the claim.
2. Uploaded files are stored in `var_attachedFile`.
3. The file-checking script determines whether files need to be processed.
4. The gateway evaluates `var_processFiles`.
5. If `true`, `doc_fileToMove` is moved.
6. `looping-logic` advances the file-processing logic.
7. The process returns to the gateway.
8. The cycle repeats while files remain.
9. When no additional files need to be processed, the gateway follows its Default Flow.
10. File processing ends.

## 🧪 LAB 7: Mapping JSON Values to Process Variables
> [!NOTE]
> **Lab Objective:**
> When a claim is submitted via the website it sends data to the process via a JSON payload.
> We need to access the JSON object to map values from the payload to our process variables.
> We should also include error handling to catch the possibility of missing data values.

**Test the Process**
1. Test the process at least one time from the [9 Second Insurance Website](https://edstrain.com/cic-9si).
   - **Password:** ```cic-demo```
2. Fill out the new claim form on the website.
2. The process will arrive at the _display-json_ Human Task.
3. This Human task is here to review the JSON structure of the HTML form submitted payload.
4. Use this as a reference going forward.

**Mapping JSON Values in the _update-vars_ script**
> [!NOTE]
> This script is partially written. It already:
> - Checks to ensure the _var_inboundRequest_ process variable is not null and contains data.
> - Checks if any images / documents were uploaded from the website and sets a true / false variable.

1. Select and open the _update-vars_ script attached to the script task with the same name.
2. Notice the section ```EXERCISE: Map inbound data to process variables``` is blank. This is where we want to map values.
   - Use the example of JSON structure and list of applicable process variables below with dot-syntax Javascript to assign each value to the correct process variable.

JSON Structure
``` 
{
   "FirstName"=value,
   "LastName"=value,
   "StreetAddress"=value,
   "City"=value,
   "State"=value,
   "Zip"=value,
   "var_email"=value,
   "DamageDate"=value,
   "DamageDescription"=value,
   "DamageType"=value
}
```

Process Variables
```
var_firstName
var_lastName
var_streetAddress
var_city
var_state
var_zip
var_email
var_perilType
var_perilDate
var_perilDescription
```

> [!NOTE]
> When complete this script task will properly map the website form data to the proper process variables, ensuring they are populated for the _create-doc_ task.

**Remove the _display-JSON_ Task.**
1. Delete the _display-JSON_ Human Task.

---  

## ✅ Lab 7 Test
Release your project and upgrade from the application from the **Studio Admin** page. 

### 🔍 Testing Checklist
Test and Verify that:

- [ ] Test from the [9 Second Insurance Website](https://edstrain.com/cic-9si/).
- [ ] Fill out and submit the claim form, attaching at least one document to the form.
- [ ] The process completes without error.
- [ ] Visit the _uidev_claims_ folder in the local repository to ensure a new folder was created for your claim. Inside should be a generated document and the document(s) you attached.

---

## 🧪 LAB 8: Additional Error Handling
> [!NOTE]
> **Lab Objective:** Next we'll add additional error handling where it makes sense.

**Add error handling (failure protection) to the _update-vars_ script (webhook path)**
If this script fails then the process should not continue. However, we've created a folder for this claim, so if the process is closed at this point, we should remove the folder.

1. Add a **Intermediate throwing event** to the _update-vars_ task.
2. Use the wrench icon to configure it as an **Error Event**.
3. In the **Error** drop-down, elect: `Any error`.
4. Add a **Delete Content Task** after the script task, but ensure a sequence flow line flows from the boundary error event to the _Delete Content Task_.
5. Assign **doc_folder** process variable to the _Content_ attribute.
6. Add an **End Event** flowing from the _Delete Content Task_.

---

- [ ] An Exclusive Gateway follows the file-checking logic.
- [ ] The Move Content path uses `var_processFiles == true`.
- [ ] Move Content uses `doc_fileToMove` as `sourceContent`.
- [ ] `looping-logic` follows Move Content.
- [ ] `looping-logic` uses **All Input / Output** mapping.
- [ ] `looping-logic` returns to the Exclusive Gateway.
- [ ] The second gateway path is configured as the Default Flow.
- [ ] The Default Flow terminates at an End Event.

---

## Test the Completed Process
After completing the configuration, save and validate the process.

Test at least the following scenarios:

> [!NOTE]
>
> ### 🧪 Test 1: Claim With No Files
>
> Start the process and submit the claim **without attaching a file**.
>
> **✅ Expected Result:**
> The process should bypass the **Move Content** loop and follow the gateway's **Default Flow**.


---  


> [!NOTE]
>
> ### 🧪 Test 2: Claim With One File
>
> Start the process and attach one file.
>
> **✅ Expected Result:**
